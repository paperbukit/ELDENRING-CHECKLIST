// We need to add the favicon link to all HTML files

// For implementation purposes, the actual favicon would be downloaded or generated
// But since we can't directly create images, we'll reference an external Elden Ring related icon
// In a real scenario, you'd want to download a favicon.ico file to the project

// Complete this implementation by adding a favicon link to each HTML file
